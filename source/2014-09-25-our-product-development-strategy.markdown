At websrvr, we have two goals:

  1. To create a product which makes the process of website development simple
     for web developers and web designers.
  2. To make these new websites blazingly fast.

And, to that end we have two teams working on websrvr. One which is focussed on
improving the performance bit by tiny bit and another to make the whole
experience enjoyable and simple.

If you have a pet feature you want us to work on, just let us know by emailing
us at: support@websrvr.zendesk.com and we'll get right on it.

Below are a few features which we'll be launching soon:

  1. Ability to use contact forms with your websites seamlessly.
  2. Add pre processors for **less, coffeescript, sass, scss and markdown**.
  3. Image optimizations for your websites.
  4. Javascript and Stylesheet concatenation support.

Stay tuned!
